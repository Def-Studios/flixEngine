# FLIX ENGINE
### Built using pygame.

Run newflix to generate a new flix project. (This will take a while, its copying the runtime)
Dont delete the new flix project folder it contains the project base that the script copies.

## You do NOT need python installed, because there is a python runtime in the src/runtime folder.
